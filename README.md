[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/JqhpRwgD/jeffs-project-board)

In this game, you will play against a computer or another human to connect four of your game pieces in a row. The first to get four in a row wins.

## Getting Started

1. Creating the grid
2. Styling the grid
3. Create game pieces - Red and Yellow
4. Creating game logic
5. Making the first navigation page with functioning buttons
6. Adding more styling to both pages
7. **Bonus** : I'd like to add sounds when a player puts their piece in a particular spot. I'd also like to have a sound when the player starts a new game.
