In this game, you will play against another human to connect four of your game pieces in a row. The first to get four in a row wins.

## How to Play

1. Argue with your friend/enemy who gets to go first.
2. Place your colored token somewhere on the board.
3. Watch out! Your opponent can also go anywhere on the board.
4. Try to connect four of your tokens in a row.
5. You can connect four in any direction, up or down, left or right, and diagonally.
6. If you see your opponent trying to be sneaky and catch you off guard, block their next move!
7. May the best connecter win!
